# SwiftSMTP

SwiftSMTP provides a SwiftNIO based implementation for sending emails using SMTP servers.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `Package.swift`:
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/sersoft-gmbh/swift-smtp", from: "2.0.0"),
```

## Documentation

The API is documented using header doc. If you prefer to view the documentation as a webpage, there is an [online version](https://sersoft-gmbh.github.io/swift-smtp) available for you.

## Contributing

If you find a bug / like to see a new feature in this package there are a few ways of helping out:

-   If you can fix the bug / implement the feature yourself please do and open a PR.
-   If you know how to code (which you probably do), please add a (failing) test and open a PR. We'll try to get your test green ASAP.
-   If you can do neither, then open an issue. While this might be the easiest way, it will likely take the longest for the bug to be fixed / feature to be implemented.
